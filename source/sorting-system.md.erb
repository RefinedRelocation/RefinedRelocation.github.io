# The Sorting System

Refined Relocation's sorting system allows the user to configure chests to accept certain items, using the [filtering](filtering.html) system.

### Sorting chests
Sorting chests are crafted as follows, with `c` standing for a chest, and `g` standing for gold ingots:

```
g g
 c
g g
```

Sorting chests are upgraded chests. To upgrade an existing chest, right click a chest with a sorting upgrade. The chests inventory will be preserved, and it will become a sorting chest. Otherwise, if you wish to create a new sorting chest, you can simply craft the chest. You can also make a chest out of the sorting chest by crafting it alone in a crafting grid, however, you will lose the gold.

### Sorting system
The sorting system allows a user to shift-right click on any sorting chest and configure what items should be allowed in that chest. The configuration uses the default [filtering](filtering.html) GUI, but with an additional priority button. The priority can be set to:

 * Low (-)
 * Normal-Low (-0)
 * Normal (0)
 * Normal-High (0+)
 * High (+)

The priorities are listed in order from least to greatest, and is used when deciding where an item should be placed. Blacklisted chests have a lower priority than whitelisted chests, even if their priority setting is the same. If two inventories with identical filters and priorities are created, the items will go to the closest inventory from the sorting inventory that was placed into.

To use the sorting system, set the filter for multiple inventories (at least 2) and then use [relocators](relocators.html) or another item transportation system to import items into the network. If you do not have access to an item transportation system, then you can manually insert items to be sorted. If no inventory in the network can accept the items, they will be placed in the chest they were placed in.

#### Sorting Connector
(`g` is gold nuggets, `s` is stone, `i` is iron ingots)

```
gsg
sis
gsg
```

The Sorting Connector will work like an extension of the Sorting System, two chests with this block in between will be in the same network. More than one sorting connector touching will still connect the Sorting Systems, so they can be used as connections between rooms. The most common use case is to connect inventories around corners, without have a chest in the corner. This block can be [disguised](#disguising).

#### Sorting Interface
(`g` is gold ingot, `i` is a sorting connector

```
g g
 i
g g
```
The sorting interface is an upgrade of the sorting connector. The sorting interface is configurable just like a sorting chest, and allows inventories without a sorting version to work with the sorting system. When placing this block, you need to shift-right click on the inventory you wish to become a sorting inventory. Once this is done, you can configure the sorting interface as if you were configuring the inventory you shift-right clicked on. The sorting interface will work like an extension of that inventory. This block can be [disguised](#disguising).

#### Sorting Importer
(`s` is redstone dust, `r` is an iron ingot, `g` is a gold ingot, and `i` is a sorting connector)

```
rgr
sis
rgr
```

The sorting importer will change any item placed in its left hand slot into the Ore Dictionary form placed into the slots on the right. The slots on the right only accept items in the Ore Dictionary, and no duplicate Ore Dictionary entries may be placed there. There are an infinite amount of slots on the right. Once converted, if it is part of a Sorting System, it will auto-place the Ore Dictionary converted form into the correct chest. This block can be [disguised](#disguising).

If you have [NEI](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/909223-164-smp-chickenbones-mods/) and [NEI Plugins](https://bitbucket.org/mistaqur/nei_plugins/wiki/Home) installed, you can show the Ore Dictionary entries for each item by going to the inventory screen with NEI enabled, then going to `Options`, then `NEIPlugins`, then `Options` for Developers, then setting `Show Ore Dictionary name for items` to `Yes`. This will display the Ore Dictionary names for each item in the tooltips.

### Mod Compatibility

* JABBA Better Barrels can be upgraded into Sorting Barrels, and they have Normal-High priority, and no filter due to only accepting the item placed in them.
* Metallurgy chests (Sorting chest version)
* Iron Chests' chests (Sorting chest version)
* Equivalent Exchange's Alchemical Chests (Sorting chest version)

### Disguising
Disguising allows the Sorting blocks to appear like any full block. This is done by, shift-right clicking on any full block and then right clicking the Sorting block, with a [Linker](misc.html#the-linker).
