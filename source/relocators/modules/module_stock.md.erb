This module has a GUI of 9 slots, and allows the user to set an amount of items to keep in an inventory. For example, you can specify to always keep 64 stone in that inventory, and then whenever stone gets routed their, it will not allow more than 64 stone to arrive in the inventory. You cannot keep more than 64 items per slot in the GUI, so you are limited to keeping 9 stacks of items in the inventory.
