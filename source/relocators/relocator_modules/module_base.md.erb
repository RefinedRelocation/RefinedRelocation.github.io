Relocator modules are applied to the connections between relocators. They are applied by right clicking this connection, and can be removed by shift-right clicking.

All modules are created using the `Module Base` item. The module base item is always stood for as `B` in crafting recipes on this page.

The module base item is crafted as follows, with `i` standing for iron ingots and `b` standing for iron bars.

```
