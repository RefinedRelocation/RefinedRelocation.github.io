# Miscellaneous Blocks and Items

### The Filtering Hopper
Crafting recipe: (where `g` stands for gold ingots and `h` stands for hoppers.)

```
g g
 h
g g
```

The filtering hopper is a [vanilla hopper](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Hopper) upgraded with Refined Relocation's [Filtering](filtering.html) system.

### The Linker
Can be crafted as such: (where `i` stands for iron ingots, `r` stands for redstone, and `e` stands for ender pearls.)

```
iri
rer
iri
```

The linker is used to configure [block extenders](extenders.html). Its main functionality is to allow a user to right click on a block and then right click on a block extender, configuring either the disguise of the block extender, or in the wireless case, setting the destination of the block extender. It can be repeatedly used, it does not reset once it has disguised a block.

By right clicking in the air, you can reset the linker's linking and as such undisguise blocks.

It can also disguise sorting connectors, sorting interfaces, and sorting importers in the same way. The sorting connectors, interfaces and importers all completely appear to be the disguised block.

### Power Limiter
Can be crafted as follows, with `i` standing for iron ingots, `r` standing for redstone, and `b` standing for redstone blocks.

```
iri
rbr

```

The Power limiter allows you to limit the amount of power that is transferred through a connection. Shift-right click the block you wish to transfer power to, and then connect your power conduits to any other face of the power limiter.

You cannot limit the amount of MJ (Buildcraft power), but you can limit RF and EU power. If an inventory can accept more than just EU or RF, then you can toggle the limiting by clicking the text on the right side of the GUI.

The power limiter can stop all power transfer or toggle power transfer in several ways, and a disabled emitter will have red dashes instead of green dashes on the sides.

 - (Default) A redstone signal will disable the emitter, if the emitter is configured to `Redstone High disabled power`
 - A redstone pulse will toggle the emitter if the emitter is set to `Redstone pulse toggles power`
 - Shift-right clicking the emitter will toggle its transmission of power.

### Player Relocation
![Variants of Relocator controller](http://i.imgur.com/CAdlRmt.png)

The two variants of player relocators are pictured above.

To relocate players, create a Relocation Controller and a Player Relocator.

 1. Place the relocation controller on the ground, with a 3x4x3 space around it. The missing blocks will now blink, place them.
  - The middle top block can either be gold or diamond, use diamond if you wish to teleport interdimensionally.
 1. Once the structure is built, right click a player relocator on the Relocation Controller and it will show that it is linked.
  - Only one player relocator may be linked to a relocation controller at the same time.
 1. Hold the right mouse button to teleport back to the relocation controller.
  - The teleportation has a cooldown of 10 minutes.
  - The teleportation will only work when the user is on the ground.

Other details about Player Relocation:
 - The player relocator cannot be rebound to a different relocation controller.
 - If in creative, the cooldown will not start, as the cooldown is based on item damage.

Crafting recipes for player relocation:
The player relocator can be crafted as follows, where `g` stands for gold ingots, `b` stands for blaze rods, `e` stands for ender pearls, `d` stands for diamonds, and `f` stands for fire charges.
