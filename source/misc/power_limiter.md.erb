title: Power Limiter
recipes: power_limiter

The Power limiter allows you to limit the amount of power that is transferred through a connection. Shift-right click to place the power limiter facing the block you wish to transfer power to, and then connect your power conduits to any other face of the power limiter.

You cannot limit the amount of MJ (Buildcraft power), but you can limit RF (Thermal Expansion power) and EU (IndustrialCraft 2 power). If the connected block can accept more than one type of power, you can toggle the limiting by clicking the text on the right side of the GUI.

The power limiter can stop all power transfer or toggle power transfer in several ways, and a disabled emitter will have red dashes instead of green dashes on the sides.

 - (Default) A redstone signal will disable the emitter, if the emitter is configured to `Redstone High disabled power`
 - A redstone pulse will toggle the emitter if the emitter is set to `Redstone pulse toggles power`
 - Shift-right clicking the emitter will toggle its transmission of power.
