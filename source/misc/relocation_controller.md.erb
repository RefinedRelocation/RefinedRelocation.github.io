To relocate players, create a Relocation Controller and a Player Relocator.

 1. Place the relocation controller on the ground, with a 3x4x3 space around it. The missing blocks will now blink, place them.
  - The middle top block can either be gold or diamond, use diamond if you wish to teleport interdimensionally.
 1. Once the structure is built, right click a player relocator on the Relocation Controller and it will show that it is linked.
  - Only one player relocator may be linked to a relocation controller at the same time.
 1. Hold the right mouse button to teleport back to the relocation controller.
  - The teleportation has a cooldown of 10 minutes.
  - The teleportation will only work when the user is on the ground.

Other details about Player Relocation:

  - The player relocator cannot be rebound to a different relocation controller.
  - If in creative, the cooldown will not start, as the cooldown is based on item damage.
