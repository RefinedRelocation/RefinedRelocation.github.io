The sorting importer will change any item placed in its left hand slot into the Ore Dictionary form placed into the slots on the right. The slots on the right only accept items in the Ore Dictionary, and no duplicate Ore Dictionary entries may be placed there. There are an infinite amount of slots on the right. Once converted, if it is part of a Sorting System, it will auto-place the Ore Dictionary converted form into the correct chest. This block can be <%= link("disguise", "disguised") %>.

If you have [NEI](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/909223-164-smp-chickenbones-mods/) and [NEI Plugins](https://bitbucket.org/mistaqur/nei_plugins/wiki/Home) installed, you can show the Ore Dictionary entries for each item by going to the inventory screen with NEI enabled, then going to `Options`, then `NEIPlugins`, then `Options` for Developers, then setting `Show Ore Dictionary name for items` to `Yes`. This will display the Ore Dictionary names for each item in the tooltips.
