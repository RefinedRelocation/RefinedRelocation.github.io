Sorting chests are upgraded chests. To upgrade an existing chest, right click a chest with a sorting upgrade. The chests inventory will be preserved, and it will become a sorting chest. Otherwise, if you wish to create a new sorting chest, you can simply craft the chest. You can also make a chest out of the sorting chest by crafting it alone in a crafting grid, however, you will lose the gold.
