The Sorting Connector will work like an extension of the Sorting System, two chests with this block in between will be in the same network. More than one sorting connector touching will still connect the Sorting System s, so they can be used as connections between rooms. The most common use case is to connect inventories around corners, without have a chest in the corner. This block can be [disguised](#disguising).
